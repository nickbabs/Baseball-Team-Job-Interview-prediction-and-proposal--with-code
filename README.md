### Player X Infield Performance Analysis

This project is a submission for a job interview where I was a finalist but did not receive the job offer. The project presents an analytical 
approach to answer the a coach's question regarding Player X's struggles in the field.

### Proposed Dataset

I proposed dataset to be used for for my approach of an analysis on Player X's performance and to analyze how we could help him improve.

### Prediction Modeling

I created a linear regression model to predict players' 2019 Season Final On-Base Percentage.

I was not selected for the job, however I believe I was able to demonstrate a good example of how to start an analytical approach to predicting player
statistical data.
